# Great-clips-Arena-simulation
Project describes end to end functioning of Great clips salon through a model built in Arena and also suggests various recommendations 
to improve the structure of organisation.
The aim is to understand the basis of Simulation concepts using “Arena” software. The purpose of the project is to prepare 
a working simulation of Great Clips Salon at 213 Calhoun St, Cincinnati. The model in Arena provides an output for many statistical values
like total number of customers served in a interval of time, time spent in the queues before being serviced, maximum service times, 
resource allocation and utilization levels etc. The input data for the model consists of inter-arrival times of the customers, 
the service times at each station and the shopping times which was collected at the peak hours of student visits at Kroger’s store. 
The model was also run for 100 replications to analyze the results, changes were made to the existing model and tested and based on the 
results suggestions are made to improve the efficiency of the salon.
